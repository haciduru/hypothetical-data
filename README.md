# hypothetical-data

I do statistical analyses a lot. I also write functions in R to conduct statistical analyses. I often need hypothetical data to test my code. It is not difficult to create hypothetical data with a few lines. However, you still need to type those codes, and it sometimes takes time. In this repository, you will find functions in R to create hypothetical data. You will also find some one-line functions that I think are very useful.
